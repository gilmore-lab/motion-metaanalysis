## Purpose

## Meeting notes

### 2018-10-26

- Goals:
    1. review the literature about the development of motion perception (and brain responses to motion).
    2. if possible, do a meta-analysis.
- Action steps:
    - Search terms
        - motion coherence children (unquoted)
        - motion perception children (unquoted)
        - motion perception review (unquoted)
        - motion perception review development (unquoted)
    - Search time period
        - Open...
    - Measure types
        - Behavioral responses
        - Brain measures if there are behavioral data
        - Brain responses only (e.g., our SSVEP)
    - How to gather sources
        - Google Scholar search
        - Tag
    - How to evaluate/code sources
        - Stimulus type
            - motion coherence, random dot kinematograms
            - biological motion. [demo](https://www.biomotionlab.ca/html5-bml-walker/)
            - grating motion/direction thresholds (temporal)
            - optic flow
        - Stimulus parameters
            - Speed
            - Pattern type (linear/uniform)
            - Direction
            - Noise/coherence
            - Spatial characteristics (spatial frequency, dot size, display size, ...)
            - Temporal characteristics (duration, frequency)
        - Person characteristics
            - ASD
            - typically developing
        - Age
        - Sex/gender
        - Measure type
        - Behavior type
            - Button pressing
            - Verbal
            - Other
    - Seek data sets?
