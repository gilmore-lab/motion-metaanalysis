## Purpose

This document describes the protocol the Gilmore Lab members are using
to conduct a review and meta-analysis of the published literature on the
development of motion sensitivity in infants, children, and adolescents.

## Protocol

### Search protocol

1.  Phase I
2.  Phase II

Look within papers we’ve tagged for references.

-   Goals:
    1.  review the literature about the development of motion perception
        (and brain responses to motion).
    2.  if possible, do a meta-analysis.
-   Action steps:
    -   Search terms (in [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/))
        -   motion coherence children (unquoted)
        -   motion perception children (unquoted)
        -   motion perception review (unquoted)
            -   source of primary references
        -   motion perception review development (unquoted)
            -   source of primary references
        -   motion perception infants (unquoted)
            -   Since 2014
    -   Search time period
        -   Open…
    -   Species
        -   human only, no non-human animals
    -   Add to PaperPile
    -   Measure types
        -   Behavioral responses
        -   Brain measures if there are behavioral data
        -   Brain responses only (e.g., our SSVEP)
    -   How to gather sources
        -   Google Scholar search
        -   Tag on PaperPile with `motion-metaanalysis`
    -   How to evaluate/code sources
        -   Complete the [Google
            Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeFVnK8m4-yoIZm04jCZjtnQX5HFmOvLsi9hnmnYbHIm216hw/viewform?vc=0&c=0&w=1)
            for each paper
        -   This will populate the Google Sheet [motion-metaanalysis
            (Responses)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1K0TEzdSXl7GTFg2-vDHvndVvxOHLRvXdgZWVDNyvPLM/edit#gid=1643485482)

            -   Phase I focuses on subset of variables (not stimulus

## Coding steps

The coding spreadsheet is located here:

The following variables have been entered already:

`Item type` `Authors` `Title`

Raters will code each selected paper with the following variables:

### `Coder`:

Enter the coder’s first name.

### `Article type`:

Enter one of the following single letter codes to describe the type of
the paper.

`R`: Review article or meta-analysis

`A`: Empirical article

`T`: Thesis or dissertation

`C`: Conference abstract

If a paper is coded as `R`, we do not need to complete the rest of the
codes about the tasks or participant demographics. Also, papers coded
`R` are excluded, and must be coded as excluded by…
